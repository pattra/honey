	Join him on his latest excursion to collect the world's most coveted source of power - honey! Enter the Great Hive, fend off angry bees, and abscond with their precious liquid gold using your honeymancy to reach the exit.<br/><br/>

				Beartholomew's honeymancy is getting out of whack! As he jumps left and right to dodge bees and reach the exit, swipe across yellow honeycombs to make a temporary platform to get his paws on. Watch out for blue gaps in the honeycombs--those are sky holes! No chance of making any platforms there.

				<p><b>Tips for Novice Honeymancers:</b></P>
				<ul>
					<li> Honeymancing power regens over time. In the meantime, conserve your energy by making more accurate platforms!</li>
					<li> Be on the lookout for angry bees! They'll try to knock you into the bubbling pit of honey below... not to mention those stingers hurt.</li>
					<li>Swimming in bees? Swat them out of your way with a tap!</li>
				</ul>
				Get as high a score as you can! Impress your friends (or at least us! We will be impressed)!
